## Greetings, fellow tech enthusiasts!

I'm a passionate computer science student at The University of Hong Kong, expected to graduate in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.

With a deep fascination for AI, computer vision, and the exciting realm of emerging technologies, I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to flex my coding muscles.

### Diving into the AI Abyss

During my time at HKU, I've had the privilege of working on some truly groundbreaking projects. As an AI Intern at the HKU InnoWing, I've collaborated with brilliant minds across various disciplines, applying cutting-edge AI techniques to tackle complex problems. From developing AI-powered workshops to conducting research on the frontiers of the field, I've been immersed in the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence.

### Exploring the Intersections of Technology and Society

But my interests don't stop at the technical realm. I'm also deeply intrigued by the intersection of technology, law, and society. Through my internships at the HKU Law and Technology Center, I've explored how language models and legal knowledge can be leveraged to empower the public with reliable legal information. Projects like CLIC-Chat and the AI-Agent Moot Court System have allowed me to dive into the exciting possibilities of integrating AI into legal education and practice.

### Pushing the Boundaries of Creativity and Storytelling

And if that wasn't enough, I've also delved into the realm of digital storytelling and immersive experiences. My course project, "Movie NGP," saw me harnessing the power of NeRF and Instant-NGP to breathe new life into classic film scenes, blending them with interactive elements for a truly captivating viewing experience.

### Eager to Collaborate and Learn

As I continue my academic journey, I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to learn, grow, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Whether it's exploring the latest advancements in 3D reconstruction, delving into the intricacies of mobile app development, or tackling the ethical challenges of AI, I'm always eager to dive in and contribute my skills and passion.

So, if you're as excited about the future of technology as I am, I'd love to connect and explore the possibilities together. Let's push the boundaries of what's possible and create something truly remarkable!
